# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


# How to Start
 
 - make sure you have nodeJS installed, because vite uses that under the hood
 - created a folder locally and opened it in vs code and ran `npm create vite@latest`
 - then you go to github and create a repo and name it the same name you used for your vite project in this case "react-example-app" and you chose to add no readme.md.
 - then you will initialize your repo locally by saying git init
 - then you do git add .
 - then you add the origin by doing `git remote add origin <*URLOFPROJECT*>` ***HINT*** => the one URL you are suggested by github upon creation in the steps to follow

- then you do can and are able to push changes to the repo remotely as the changes where already pushed when you said git remote add origin and the URL.
    -  you can git add . && -m "a meaningul message" or you can:
        - `git add`
        - `git commit -m " meaningful message" `
        - `git push origin master`
